BMI Module Documentation


Introduction :
The BMI (Body Mass Index) module is a Python package that provides functions to calculate the BMI
value based on weight and height, as well as to interpret the BMI value and provide a correspondinghealth category. This module is designed to help users assess their body mass index and gain insightsinto their weight status.
BMI Module Functions:
1. calculate_bmi(weight_kg, height_m):
This function calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) using the weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters)provided as input. The formula for BMI calculation is:
```BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) ** 2)```
Parameters:
- >weight_kg(float): The weight of the person in kilograms.
- >height_m(float): The height of the person in meters.
Returns:
- >bmi_value(float): The calculated BMI value.
Example Usage :
from bmi_module import calculate_bmi
weight = 70 # in kilograms
height = 1.75 # in meters
bmi = calculate_bmi(weight, height)
print(f"Your BMI is: {bmi:.2f}")
2. interpret_bmi(bmi_value) :
This function interprets the BMI value and provides a corresponding health category. It categorizes theBMI value into different health status groups, ranging from "Severely underweight" to "Obesity Class III
(Very severe or morbidly obese)."
Parameters:
- >bmi_value (float): The calculated BMI value.
Returns:
- >health_category (str): The health category corresponding to the provided BMI value.
Example Usage:
from bmi_module import interpret_bmi
bmi = 25.5
health_category = interpret_bmi(bmi)
print(f"Interpretation: {health_category}")

3.Health Categories and Interpretation :
The BMI value is categorized into the following health categories:
Severely underweight : BMI < 16
Underweight : 16 <= BMI < 16.9
Mildly underweight : 17 <= BMI < 18.4
Normal weight : 18.5 <= BMI < 24.9
Overweight : 25 <= BMI < 29.9
Obesity Class I (Moderate) : 30 <= BMI < 34.9
Obesity Class II (Severe) : 35 <= BMI < 39.9
Obesity Class III (Very severe or morbidly obese) : BMI >= 40
Notes :
- > The BMI value is a general indicator of body mass and does not take into account individual factorssuch as muscle mass or body composition. It is essential to consult with a healthcare professional for acomprehensive evaluation of your health status.
- > The `calculate_bmi` function assumes that the provided height is a positive value in meters. Any nonpositive value will raise a `ValueError`.
Conclusion :
The BMI module is a useful tool for individuals to calculate their BMI and understand their weight statusbased on widely accepted health categories. By incorporating this module into your Python projects, youcan gain valuable insights into your body mass index and make informed decisions about your healthand well-being. Remember to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized health advice andguidance
Here is a code for bmi:
The BMI module consists of two functions:
1. calculate_bmi(weight_kg, height_m): This function takes the weight (in kilograms) and height (inmeters) as input and calculates the BMI using the formula BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) ** 2). Itchecks if the provided height is positive (greater than 0) and raises a ValueError if it is not. Thecalculated BMI value is then returned.
2. interpret_bmi(bmi_value): This function takes the BMI value as input and interprets it based onpredefined BMI ranges. Depending on the BMI value, it returns a string representing the health category(e.g., "Normal weight," "Overweight," etc.).
Example Usage:
Final Conclusion
1. The BMI (Body Mass Index) module is a Python package designed to provide functionalitiesrelated to calculating the BMI value and interpreting the BMI to assess an individual's weight status. Itconsists of two essential functions: `calculate_bmi` and `interpret_bmi`.
2. The `calculate_bmi` function takes the weight in kilograms and height in meters as input andcalculates the BMI using the formula `BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m) ** 2)`. It ensures that theprovided height is a positive value and raises a `ValueError` if it is not. The function returns thecalculated BMI value.
3. The `interpret_bmi` function takes the BMI value as input and categorizes it into differenthealth status groups, ranging from "Severely underweight" to "Obesity Class III (Very severe or
morbidly obese)." Based on the BMI value, the function returns a string representing the healthcategory.
4. By incorporating this module into your Python projects, you can easily calculate your BMI
and gain insights into your weight status. However, it's important to remember that BMI is a general
indicator and may not fully capture individual variations in body composition or muscle mass. For acomprehensive evaluation of your health status, it's recommended to consult with a healthcareprofessional.
5. To use the BMI module, make sure the `bmi_module.py` file is present in your project
directory. You can then import the functions and use them to calculate your BMI and interpret theresults. Example usage of the BMI module has been provided in the documentation to guide youthrough its implementation.
6. In conclusion, the BMI module is a helpful tool to assist you in understanding your body massindex and make informed decisions about your health and well-being. Remember to approach BMI aspart of a broader approach to health, including regular exercise, a balanced diet, and consultationwith healthcare experts for personalized health advice and guidance.
